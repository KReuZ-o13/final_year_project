# final_year_project
 These are the scripts in the final year project. The first is silence removal, the second diarization and the third transcription. Only the first and third are present though.
The silence removal scripts are better_silence_removal.py, speech_silence_2.py and silence_remover_using_pyAudioAnalysis.py. The working files is better_silence_removal.
The temporary diarisation file is diarisation_using_pyAudioAnalysis.
The transcription scripts are something.py, aother_atch_attempt.py and closest_so_far.py. The only one that functions as expected is something.py, but it is limited to roughly 5 seconds of audio. 
There are weird errors when using pyAUdioAnalysis (why are both arrays a single digit off?)
